## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **hands-on backend engineer with 12+ years of experience** building **high-performance, scalable backend systems** using **Java and Python**.

My core strengths are:
- Designing **rule engines & microservices**
- Writing **clean, maintainable backend code**
- Improving **performance, throughput, and reliability**
- Working close to real business problems (documents, compliance, data validation)

I enjoy solving **hard backend problems**, refactoring legacy systems, and building things that scale.
